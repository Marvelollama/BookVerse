# BookVerse
A library book management system to reinforce OOP concepts in Python3

## Description
BookVerse is a lightweight, fully object-oriented library management system built in Python to simulate how libraries manage books and members. Designed to reinforce OOP concepts like inheritance, operator overloading, and encapsulation, this project aims to create a dynamic, extensible system where books, rare manuscripts, and members interact through meaningful and modular Python classes.

Whether you're tracking rare books or managing who borrowed what, BookVerse helps you understand OOP from the ground up â€” with the simplicity of Python and the elegance of custom behavior.
